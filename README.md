# The Readme Generator

## Description
This application makes it easier software engineers and developers to write documentation for their applications using the command line and node.js. By answering a series of various prompts about the application a user is striving to create documentation for, this application provides users with a simple format for composing their documentation and automatically saves their responses as a "README.md" file. Through its creation, I was able to apply what I had learned about Node.js, CS6, NPM modularization, and inquirer.
